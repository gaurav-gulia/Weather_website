# Weather_forecast_website
This project is a simple weather website that allows users to input a country and city to get the current weather information. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.


➡️ The information is displayed using an API. An API provides a fast, consistent and reliable way to get third party data. An API may be used for database communication between web applications. By extracting the implementation and relinquishing data into objects, an API simplifies programming ❗

➡️ The API used here : (https://openweathermap.org/api)
